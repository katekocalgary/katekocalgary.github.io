Our efforts are focussed on seniors' & older adults' wellness. Our philosophy is prevention, empowerment and advocacy. 

# Projects:

**At Symons Valley United Church** - The CONNECT group meets every Wednesday at 10am for 2 hours. Older adults and seniors meet for physical activities, table games, conversations and friendships.



**At East Village** - The EmbRace project is aimed at empowering East Village seniors with knowledge and awareness to understand racism and appreciate the rich diversities of cultures in our community. The project also equips local area seniors with the skills necessary to respond positively to acts of racism.
